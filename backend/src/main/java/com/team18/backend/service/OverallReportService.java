     According to the paper [1] LAN Li. Research on the influence mechanism and evaluation of indoor environment on personnel's work efficiency [D]. Shanghai Jiao Tong University,2010.
     * Witterseh, however, studied the effect of temperature on simulated office tasks and found that temperatures ranging from neutral to slightly warmer conditions had a significant effect
     * There is no significant impact on people's office efficiency (21-25); Lorsch proposed the existence of a critical temperature (32.2-35).
     * Indoor temperatures higher than this can significantly reduce performance on mental tasks. And according to [2] Zhang Yingjie. Experimental Study on the Effect of Temperature and CARBON dioxide on Human Comfort in Narrow Space [D]. Chongqing University,2018.
     * Heart rate increases as the temperature rises
     * That is, according to the temperature below 21, 21-25 range, 25-32.2 range, 32 above the four standard analysis.
     *
     * According to [1] Xie Xiaoxu. Health effects of long-term PM_(2.5) exposure on blood pressure and heart rate and its attributable risk in Chinese aged 20-49 years [D]. Beijing union medical college, 2019. DOI: 10.27648 /, dc nki. Gzxhu. 2019.000285.
     * PM2.5 and tachycardia showed a linear increase.
     * At the same temperature, in a poorly ventilated environment, the human body is always in a state of mental stress, which causes the heart rate to rise.
     * and [2] Yingjie Zhang. Experimental Study on the Effect of Temperature and CARBON dioxide on Human Comfort in Narrow Space [D]. Chongqing University,2018.
     *
     * Due to equipment limitations, only a comprehensive index of air quality can be obtained, which is analyzed according to three standards: excellent air quality below 35, good air quality between 35 and 45, and poor air quality above 45
     *
     *
     * According to [1] Yang Yaru. Indoor noise effects on job performance [D]. Zhejiang university of technology, 2020. The DOI: 10.27786 /, dc nki. GZJLG. 2020.000472.
     * [1] Jing Guoxun, Wang Yuansheng, Zhou Fei, Guo Shaoshuai. Effect of short-term noise exposure on heart rate of workers [J]. Industrial safety and environmental protection,2019,45(08):70-73.
     * (1) Noise stimulation will affect human heart rate, causing human heart rate to rise
     * high;
     * (2) The level of noise stimulation and exposure time were both opposite to the subjects
     * heart rate had a significant effect;
     * (3) Due to the adaptability of the human ear to noise, water in the same noise
     * Under flat stimulation, the heart rate will recover briefly as the exposure time increases
     * after;
     * (4) Under the noise level < 95 dB noise stimulation, with the violence
     * The increase of exposure time, people's adaptability to noise is more obvious, at this time
     *, 72,
     * Noise exposure time is the leading factor affecting human heart rate, and in noise
     * When exposed to 40 ~ 50 min, due to the adaptability of human ear to noise
     * There is a temporary recovery of heart rate and human fatigue.
     * (5) Under the noise level > 95 dB noise stimulation, with the violence
     * With the increase of exposure time, people have no obvious adaptability to noise, and the heart rate follows the noise
     * The increase in decibels is slowly rising, when the noise level is affected
     * The leading factor in human heart rate variation.
     *
     *
     * 1.1 Analyze whether the heart rate rises and the noise >95;
     * 1.2 When the noise <=95, whether the heart rate is not in a rising state
     * 2. Analyze whether the heart rate rises and the AIR quality index is higher than 35, and the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature is less than 5Â°
     * 3. Analyze whether the heart rate is increasing and the ambient temperature is higher than 25
